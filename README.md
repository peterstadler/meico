Meico is a converter framework for MEI files. MEI offers an invaluable combination of symbolic music data and additional information far beyond the typical metadata found in other formats. All this is often based on musicological research and features an accordingly high scientific quality. Digital music editions motivate new interesting research questions highly relevant to MIR and the demand to gain deeper insight into subjects such as composition styles, performance practices, historical change processes in music tradition, and how all these reflect in the musical works edited. In this, MIR can make valuable contributions to musicology, for instance by providing tools to work on large corpora of MEI encoded music. Further application scenarios include digital music stand technology, music notation and music production. Even though MEI is a quasi-standard for digital music editions, there is few software support for it. Processing MEI encoded music is by far not a trivial task and many application scenarios have their own more established and efficient formats. With meico we address these issues. Meico implements methods to convert MEI data several other format, making MEI encodings accessible to a variety of applications. We presented meico at the Audio Mostly conference in 2018, the paper can be found [here](http://www.cemfi.de/wp-content/papercite-data/pdf/berndt-2018-meico.pdf) and in the ACM Digital Library. Currently, meico is a beta release. The following features are implemented:

- MEI to MSM conversion (with variable time resolution in pulses per quarter, ppq),
- MSM conversion to MIDI and sequences of chroma and absolute pitch vectors,
- MIDI to PCM audio and MP3 conversion (with freely choosable SoundFont and Downloadable Sounds),
- MIDI to MSM conversion,
- MEI score rendering (based on Verovio),
- MEI processing functions (validation, `xml:id` generation, resolution of elements with `copyof` attribute, conversion of `expansion` elements into "through-composed" MEI code),
- MSM processing functions (remove rest elements from the score, expand repetitions encoded in the `sequencingMap`),
- an instrument dictionary and several string matching algorithms to map staff names to MIDI program change numbers,
- basic MIDI and audio playback,
- two standalone modes (command line mode, desktop gui mode),
- a REST API,
- processing of XML sources with XSLT stylesheets, e.g. to convert MEI to MusicXML using the Music Encoding Initiative's `mei2musicxml.xsl` stylesheet from the [MEI Encoding Tools GitHub](https://github.com/music-encoding/encoding-tools).

There are several features open, though. Currently, meico ignores any MEI data that is concerned with expressive performance (tempo, dynamics, articulation, ornamentation). We would also like to include MusicXML support. Several MEI elements and attributes are not supported so far (e.g. `meterSigGrp`, `uneume`, `lyrics`). Meico implements a default method to resolve ambiguity (e.g., choose a reading from different alternatives in MEI). If other choices should be made, the user can use [MEI Sequence Editor](http://nashira.uni-paderborn.de:5555/seditor) to prepare an unambiguous MEI file.

### How to use meico?

Meico can be used in several different ways. The jar file (see the [latest release](https://github.com/cemfi/meico/releases/latest)) is a standalone runnable Java program. We have tested it under Windows, Mac OS and Linux. The only prerequisite is that you have a Java 1.8 (or higher) Runtime Environment installed on your computer.

Starting the standalone jar without any command line options will start the window mode of meico. Simply drag your MEI, MSM, MIDI, and Wave files into the window. You can find context information on each interface element in the statusbar. If you have several mdivs in your MEI document you will get an individual MSM instance for each movement. Conversion from MIDI to audio may take some time when it is a long piece. To get better quality sounds than Java's built-in default instruments (those used for the Midi playback function), we recommend using a higher-quality soundbank, such as one of [these soundfonts](https://sourceforge.net/projects/androidframe/files/soundfonts/). Simply drag and drop them on the workspace and activate them via their menu or double click. XSL file are used in the same way. If you want to apply an XSL Transform to your MEI or MSM data, drop the XSL over the workspace, activate it and transform. Soundfonts and XSLTs can also be set as standard so that this loading procedure is not necessary any further.

The command line mode expects the following command line options:

The final argument should always be a path to a valid MEI file (e.g., `"C:\myMeiCollection\test.mei"`); always in quotes! This is the only mandatory argument if you want to convert something.

The third way of using meico is as a Java programming library. Its `Mei`, `Msm`, `Midi`, and `Audio` classes are the most important to work with. Class `meico.app.Main` demonstrates the use of meico (method `commandLineMode()` is best suited as tutorial). With `meicoPy.py` we have also a demo script that shows the usage of [meico in Python](https://github.com/cemfi/meico/tree/master/meicoPy). Unfortunately, we have no API documentation, yet. But the source files are extensively commented and should suffice as makeshift.

We further provide a Python3-based [REST API for meico](https://github.com/cemfi/meico/tree/master/rest).

### Build Instructions

Meico can quickly be built using [Ant](http://ant.apache.org/):
```bash
$ git clone https://github.com/cemfi/meico.git
$ cd meico
$ ant
```
The resulting `meico.jar` can be found in `out/artifacts/meico`.
